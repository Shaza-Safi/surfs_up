## Overview of the analysis:

### Background:
In this module challenge I am interested in opening a surf shop in Hawaii that sells surfing equipment and also sells icream to customers. I want to name it Surf n'Shake shop.
I do have some saving but I will need the help of investors to get this idea off the ground. I have prepared a strong business plan to reach out an investor W.Avy who loves surfing. W.Avy is willing to invest in my shop but he was concerened about the weather in Hawaii as his previous attemp to open a surf shop failed due to lack of weather analysis.  

### Purpose:
The investor proposes to run an analysis on weather dataset he has on Oahu island in Hawaii to identify if the weather will affect the conituity of this indistry and shop we wish to have him invest in.

## Results:
>> Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


Some takeaways from the above two tables:
Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
the maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar.
the minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.

## Summary:
>> Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Oevrall the weather in December and June are historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.

Additional queries that could be run include: Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather, as well as a comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
