# Surfs_Up
## Overview of the analysis:

### Background:
In this module challenge I am interested in opening a surf shop in Hawaii that sells surfing equipment and also sells icream to customers. I want to name it Surf n'Shake shop.
I do have some saving but I will need the help of investors to get this idea off the ground. I have prepared a strong business plan to reach out an investor W.Avy who loves surfing. W.Avy is willing to invest in my shop but he is concerned about the weather in Hawaii as his previous attempt to open a surf shop failed due to lack of weather analysis.  

### Purpose:
The investor proposes to run an analysis on a weather dataset he has on Oahu island in Hawaii to identify if the weather will affect prosperity of that business.

## Results:

Output from June analysis:

Output from December analysis:

Some takeaways from the above two tables:
- Average temperature  June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively. The difference between the two months is very minor when comparing averages.

- Maximum temperatures of 85 in June and 83 in December also demonstrate a very little fluctuation.

- Minimum temperature of 64 in June and 56 in December. The drop temperature from June to December is more noticable and may cause a negative impact on the business as the demand for suring and also ice cream is less when associated with lower temperature. 

## Summary:

When comparing historical temperature observations for the months of June and Decemeber we notice on a high level that the fluctuation in temperatures is relatively small in averages and maximum temperatures. Howevere the temprature reduces in the month of December which may lead to an impact on the sucess of the buisness.

### Additional queries that could be run: 

1- A precipitation analysis can done on the months of June and December as raining seasons can definitely have an impact on the surfing buisness not to mention the ice cream selling business. 

2- Compare weather station observations for those two periods taking into acount closer station in distance as they can be more precise and relevant to the location we are conducting the analysis on.
